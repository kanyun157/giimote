# Introduction #

Pairing the Wii Remote with the computer is a fairly strait forward process, however, the Wii Remote is not compatible with all Bluetooth hardware. If this does not work as expected you may have incompatible hardware.


# Instructions #

  1. Start up your Bluetooth software and have it search for a device.
  1. Hold down the 1 and 2 buttons on the Wii Remote.  You should see the LEDs at the bottom start flashing. Do not let go of these buttons until this procedure is complete.
  1. The device should show up in the list of devices found as Nintendo RVL-CNT-01. If it's not there, start over and try again.
  1. Click Next to move your way through the wizard. If at any point you are asked to enter a security code or PIN, leave the number blank or click Skip.
  1. You may be asked which service to use for the Wii Remote.  Select the keyboard/mouse/HID service.

That's it. The LEDs at the bottom should continue to flash and you should see the device listed in your list of connected Bluetooth devices.
