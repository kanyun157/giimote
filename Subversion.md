# Introduction #

Subversion is no longer used as part of the GiiMote build process. It has been superseded by [Mercurial](Mercurial.md).

It was previously used in the ["Release" configuration](ReleaseConfiguration.md) to export a clean (non-revisioned) copy of the source from which a tarball could be created.
